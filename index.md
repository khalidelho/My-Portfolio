_My name is Khalid Elhousieny. I am a Junior at the University of Washington Bothell. I am working towards a Computer Science and Software Engineering degree._ 

I am passionate about the latest technologies and entrepreneurship. During my time in high school, I started two big projects with my friends, one of them I talk about here. I gained a lot of experience from these projects, such as: how to work in a team, meeting deadlines, shipping the product, learning a new programming language, and much more. Most notably, I believe talking to customers and gaining feedback is a crucial step in creating and shipping a product. 

**I will be posting my resume on this page, and make sure to check out the other pages for my projects and information on resources to help you become a better programmer.**
